## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

âœ… How to configure and use the Controlâ€‘M CLI to interact with your Control-M SaaS environment

âœ… How to log in and navigate the Controlâ€‘M SaaS Web UI

âœ… How to explore and understand a Jobs-as-Code workflow

âœ… How to apply naming standards and personalize a workflow using a Deploy Descriptor

Step 1: Set Up the Control-M CLI Environment
===
>ðŸ’¡ **What this is**: Controlâ€‘M CLI commands run against an environment, which is just a combination of a Controlâ€‘M API endpoint and your authentication token.
1. In the [button label="Terminal"](tab-0) tab, add the **preprod** environment (this points the CLI to your Controlâ€‘M SaaS PreProd instance):
```run
ctm env add preprod [[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_AAPI_ENDPOINT" hostname="server" ]] [[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_AUTH_TOKEN" hostname="server" ]]
```
> ðŸ§ **Why this matters**: The Control-M CLI is your gateway to automating workflows programmatically. Defining your environment lets you securely connect and interact with the Control-M API. For more information, refer to the documentation:  [Environment Service](https://documents.bmc.com/supportu/controlm-saas/en-US/Documentation/API_Services_EnvironmentService.htm#environmentadd)

Step 2: Login to Control-M SaaS for the First Time
===
>ðŸ’¡ **What this is**:
1. Locate the email titled "Welcome to Helix Control-M!". Sent to: `[[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_USER" hostname="server" ]]`.
2. Retrieve your login credentials:
	- From the email, copy your <b>User name</b>  and  <b>Password</b> and store them for the next step.
3.  In Instruqt, click on the [button label="Control-M SaaS"](tab-2) tab to open the Control-M SaaS Web UI.
4. Paste your <b>User name</b>  and  <b>Password</b> from the email and Login.

Step 3: Explore the Whiskey Retail Data Pipeline and the Payments Worfklow
===
>ðŸ’¡ **What this is**:
1. In the [button label="Code Editor"](tab-1) tab,  open `~/workflows/data-pipeline.json`.
2. Take a moment to review the job flow:
3. Open `~/workflows/payments.json`.
4. Take a moment to review the job flow:

Step 4: Prepare the Data Pipeline for Updates
===
>ðŸ’¡ **What this is**: Before updating, youâ€™ll personalize the workflow and apply company standards to avoid conflicts and ensure compliance.
1. In the [button label="Code Editor"](tab-1) tab, open `~/workflows/deploy-descriptor.json`.
2. Replace all placeholder values:
	- **replace-with-usercode** = `[[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_USER_CODE" hostname="server" ]]`
	- **replace-with-email** = `[[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_USER" hostname="server" ]]`
3.  In the [button label="Terminal"](tab-0) tab, transform the workflow using the Deploy Descriptor:
```bash
cd /home/controlm/spark-innovation-with-controlm/whiskey-retail-data-pipeline/workflows/
ctm deploy transform data-pipeline.json deploy_descriptor.json > [[ Instruqt-Var key="CTM_USER_CODE" hostname="server" ]]_data-pipeline.json
```
4. Ensure the transformation is correct.
> ðŸ§  **Why this matters**: Organizations usually enforce naming conventions, folder structures, and ownership rules for all Controlâ€‘M jobs, called Site Standards. If you deploy without aligning to these standards, you risk overwriting other jobs or causing conflicts.  For more information, refer to the documentation:  [Deploy Descriptor](https://documents.bmc.com/supportu/controlm-saas/en-US/Documentation/API_DeployDescriptor.htm)
