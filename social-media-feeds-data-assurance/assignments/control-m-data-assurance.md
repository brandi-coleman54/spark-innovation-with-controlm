# Control-M Data Assurance Overview

Data Assurance Architecture
==

Data Assurance consists of two components, as follows:
- **Data Assurance Plug-in**: Connects to one or more data sources and is installed on an Agent. You can install the Data Assurance plug-in on multiple Agents and connect each Data Assurance plug-in to the Data Assurance Server.
- **Data Assurance Server**: Connects to and analyzes the data from the Data Assurance plug-in, and is installed on a separate Linux host.
